## Reflection

This project was somehow both harder and easier than I anticipated. I learned a lot about table relationships and ERDs. I learned how to make a toggle switch from scratch using CSS and linking it with JavaScript to perform a specific task. (In this case, dark mode.) I want to go back and do the leftover stretch goals in the future to improve the user experience further.
